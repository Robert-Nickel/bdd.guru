<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>The ultimate goal for every agile process is to turn work into value in a sustainable way. In the context of software engineering, humans automate solutions to problems by explaining them in much detail to machines, that do not have a common sense. Thus, the machines can solve the automatable problems and humans can focus on the not automatable tasks: To further explain the right solutions to problems to a machine in the right way. This discipline is software engineering. The result of explaining the right solution to a machine the right way is good software. In all this there are (at least) two major problems:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Misunderstandings in inter-human communication</li>
</ol>
<p>Often communication between people is required before software can be built, because in many cases some people have the skills to explain a solution to a machine, and other people have a deep understanding of the solution itself. The classical approach to to solve this problem is called specification.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Perceived functional dissonance of software</li>
</ol>
<p>Sometimes people think that software works in a certain way but it doesn’t. While or after building software, some features might work at some point in time and then break without humans recognizing it. The software might stop (or even worse: not stop) in critical, unexpected moments which can cost, depending on the software, a lot of customers, money or even lifes. The common approach to solve this problem is called quality assurance and contains testing the software repeatedly.</p>
<p>The effects of these problems need to be discovered. In a waterfall-based approach the feedback cycle closes only after an increment went through specification, implementation and quality assurance, which means, that if any increment went off track, it is discovered at a late point in time.</p>
<p>The fundamental idea of BDD is to focus on the behavior of a software system while moving the solutions to the above mentioned problems, specification and quality assurance, closer together.<span class="citation" data-cites="nagy2018discovery">(Nagy and Rose 2018, 3)</span> Thereby, the feedback cycle shortens and off-track increments are harder to produce and less impactful. In this essay I want to elaborate on how BDD leverages this idea into building sustainable software, which principles and tools it uses to do so and to what extent it can be assumed that BDD works.</p>
<h2 id="why-behavior-driven-development">Why Behavior-driven development?</h2>
<p>The annual “State of Agile” Report started 2007 and provides since then insights into the application of agile methodologies and practices over a large range of different companies worldwide. For the 14th State of Agile Report 1121 surveys were collected <span class="citation" data-cites="stateOfAgile14">(<span>“State of Agile 14th Report”</span> 2020, 5)</span> and for the Report from 2015 even 3880 surveys where collected<span class="citation" data-cites="stateOfAgile10">(<span>“State of Agile 10th Report”</span> 2016, 2)</span>. The survey is handed out to agile practicioners and executives. It is aimed to be representative in terms of localization, company size and industries and it exists since more than 12 years, therefore it might contain a convincing insight into the employment of BDD, at least among the companies that participated in the survey. This table of percental BDD employment per year shows a significantly growing application of BDD, especially since 2015 BDD appears to gain relevance each year except 2019.<span class="citation" data-cites="nagy2018discovery">(Nagy and Rose 2018, 9f)</span></p>

<p>BDD is listed under different captions: In the earlier surveys it was listed as an agile method, then it was listed as an agile technique and since 2016 it is listed as engineering practice.</p>
<p>// QUESTION: should I do this? Another approach understand the interest in BDD is to have a look at Google Trends: <img src="images/google_trends_bdd_topic.png" /> <span class="citation" data-cites="googleTrendsBddTopic">(<span>“Data Source: Google Trends,”</span> n.d.)</span></p>
<p>This graphic visualizes the interest in BDD as topic over time relative to the past highest interest, in this case in December 2004, for Google web searches. The graphic displays some high interest from late 2004 until mid 2007, a peak in mid 2010 and since then a relative interest of around 30% until the present day. This appears odd and does not match the state of agile reports intuitively, assuming that people in the software industry use the Google web search to search for applied practices. One possible explanation is, that people in the software industry might be early adopters of alternatives to the Google web search.</p>
<h2 id="the-principles-of-behavior-driven-development">The Principles of Behavior-driven development</h2>
<p>The term behavior-driven development, as it was introduced by Dan North in 2006<span class="citation" data-cites="north2006introducing-bdd">(North, n.d.)</span>, explicitly avoided the term “test” in order to keep business people engaged.[nagy2018discovery, p.10] This is a strong hint towards the most fundamental principle of BDD: bringing the specification and the quality assurance together or in other terms: “Bridging the Communication Gap,” which is the title of the book by Gojko Adzic<span class="citation" data-cites="Adzic2009Bridging">(Adzic 2009)</span> that describes a very similar idea which he names “specification by example” and “agile acceptance testing.”</p>
<h3 id="from-tdd-to-bdd">From TDD to BDD</h3>
<p>Dan North describes in “Introducing BDD” how BDD is his response to TDD. In order to get a deeper understanding of what that means, we must have a closer look at TDD. TDD is a narrower approach, in which only technically focussed people are involved. The idea is to write a test that describes a feature which doesn’t exist yet, ensure it fails, and then implement that feature until the test does not fail anymore. After the new test is executed successfully and none of the existing tests is broken, the developer can move on to the next test for the next feature. This test-first approach is mentioned in the early publications about Extreme Programming<span class="citation" data-cites="Lindstrom2004ExtremePA">(Lindstrom and Jeffries 2004)</span>.</p>
<p>According to the agile alliance glossary<span class="citation" data-cites="agileAllianceTDD">(<span>“Glossary: TDD,”</span> n.d.)</span>, common pitfalls of a TDD using team are a “poor maintenance of the test suite – most commonly leading to a test suite with a prohibitively long running time” which sometimes leads to a “abandoned test suite (i.e. seldom or never run)[…].” Dan North explains some further pitfalls, that range from the naming of the tests, which might cause some “false sense of security”<span class="citation" data-cites="north2006introducing-bdd">(North, n.d.)</span>, to the scope and the actual functionality that needs to be tested. Thinking in terms of behavior solved these issues: The naming of an executable test is based on the behavior it should assure. The scope of the test is easier defined on the level of behavior (rather on the more technical level of test), because a behavior description has naturally a certain length and a functional scope that excludes all technical details. The question, which features should be tested, also became easier to answer: All of the behavior, that the software should have, needs to be tested. Lower level tests, which ensure the software uses a specific solution, step back and the testing scope shifts towards tests that describe the behavior of a system. Latter correlate to the original intent of writing the software and therefore are getting closer to stakeholders attention. Concluding this chapter: BDD is a successor of TDD in its nature, but shifts its scope towards a more behavioral and less technical level. At the same time, TDD can be used inside of BDD, so that both layers are addressed at the same time<span class="citation" data-cites="nagy2018discovery">(Nagy and Rose 2018, 15)</span>.</p>
<h3 id="examples-and-business-rules">Examples and Business Rules</h3>
<p>Examples are a mighty tool in BDD, which are used to illustrate business rules and therefore reduce the chance of misinterpreting them<span class="citation" data-cites="nagy2018discovery">(Nagy and Rose 2018, 48)</span>.</p>
<p>Examples consist of a context, an action and an outcome. The context is the state of the system before the action is applied to it. The action is the stimulus that causes the system to react. It might be another system, some scheduled action or the user of the system. The outcome is the updated state of the system after the action has taken place<span class="citation" data-cites="nagy2018discovery">(Nagy and Rose 2018, 43)</span>. It should focus on that part of the system that was influenced by the action, and does not need to contain irrelevant aspects. Moreover, an example always contains concrete data in contrast to variables. An example is what can be used to write a test for a system. One example of an example from the world of poker:</p>
<pre><code>- Table is preflop
- Amy is on the button
- Amy has a stack of 50BB
- Bob is small blind
- Carl is big blind
- Amy has aces
- Bob and Carl post the blinds
* Amy raises 3BB  
=&gt; Raise is accepted</code></pre>
<p><em>Here, the dashes stand for the context, the asterisk for the action and the bold arrow for the outcome.</em></p>
<p>The examples alone cannot describe the behavior of a system sufficiently. Therefore, the business rules exist, which are the abstract description of the general problem. A business rule is what gets implemented in the software. When defining a business rule, it is often the case that it is deduced from a concrete situation (= example) in which the system should behave in a specific way.</p>
